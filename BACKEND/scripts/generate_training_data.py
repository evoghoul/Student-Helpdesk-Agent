            "Assuming your class has held 50 lectures so far, a 62% attendance means you have attended 31 classes.\n"

            "**57 / 76 = 75.0%**. Attending fewer than 26 remaining classes cannot reach the 75% cutoff from this starting point.\n\n"
            "### 3. Medical & Co-Curricular Condonation (Clause 4.2.b)\n"
            "If you missed classes due to a genuine medical illness or representing the university in sports/cultural events, "
            "the Dean of Academic Affairs has discretionary authority to condone attendance **down to 65%** upon submission of verified medical documentation "

            "the **best scores** across formative assessments.\n"
            "- Even if CIE-1 didn't go the way you hoped, scoring well on CIE-2 directly offsets it and secures your internal passing eligibility.\n\n"
            "### 2. Prioritize High-Yield Topics\n"
            "- Don't try to cram 100% of the syllabus in one night. Focus on the core 60% that carries 80% of exam weightage.\n"
            "- Solve the previous two years' question papers—most university question patterns follow standardized blueprints.\n\n"
            "### 3. Faculty & Mentor Support\n"
            "- Your faculty mentor is there specifically to help in situations like this. They can grant you assignment grace extensions and provide directed study guides.\n\n"
