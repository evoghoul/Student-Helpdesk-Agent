Under **Examination Ordinance Clause 8.2 & Academic Regulation R22 (Clause 4.3)**, an **automatic gate-controlled hold** is enforced.\n\n### Dual Requirement Breakdown:\n1. **Tuition Balance Hold (Agent 40 - Finance)**: The portal checks your accounting status. Any outstanding tuition or lab fee flags the record as *\"Financial Dues Pending\"*, preventing hall ticket generation.\n2. **Medical Condonation Hold (Agent 11 - Attendance & Medical Board)**: While an attendance condonation application is *\"Pending\"*, the statutory system treats your attendance as unapproved. A hall ticket can only be unlocked once the Medical Board and Dean of Academics mark the condonation status as **APPROVED** (for attendance between 65% and 74.9%).\n\n### Required Action to Release the Hold:\n• **Step 1**: Clear tuition balance via the Finance portal (or submit an approved Dean-authorized installment waiver).\n• **Step 2**: Ensure your registered medical certificate is signed off by the University Medical Officer before the condonation deadline (typically 7 days prior to exam start).\n• Once both flags update to **CLEARED**, your hall ticket will immediately become available for download in the portal.`,
